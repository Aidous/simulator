# A ROS/ROS2 Multi-robot Simulator for Autonomous Vehicles

## Summary

We present a Unity-based multi-robot simulator for autonomous vehicle developers. We provide an open-source, out-of-the-box solution which can meet the needs of developers wishing to focus on testing their autonomous vehicle algorithms. It currently has integration with the MIT DuckieTown and Autoware platforms, can generate HD maps, and be immediately used for testing and validation of a whole system with little need for custom integrations. We hope to build a collaborative community among robotics and autonomous vehicle developers by open sourcing our efforts.
